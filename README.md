# Calendar Communication Management System

## Overview
This project is a **Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Communication Management System** designed to streamline communication tracking for companies. It allows users to:

- View companies and their communication details.
- Log communications by company name or ID.
- Highlight overdue and upcoming communications.
- Provide authentication and role-based access control (Admin/User).

The system is built using:

- **Frontend**: React with Material-UI
- **Backend**: Express.js with MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

## Features

- **Login** with JWT-based authentication.
- Middleware to verify token validity and restrict access based on roles.

### Company Management
- View all companies and their communication history.
- Add, update, and delete companies (Admin only).
- Log communications for companies by name or ID.

### Communication Tracking
- Highlight overdue communications in red.
